# Hugging-The-Hugging-Face

In this work we will present the outcome of fine-tuning two different pretrained models for completing a sentiment analysis task. Moreover, we will go over the common and uncommon methods used to improve the model's metrics and the adjustments made to our specific task - analysis of IMDB reviews. Finally, we will present a comparison between two methods used to reduce the size of the pretrained model and discuss the recommended steps one can take to possibly obtain better results in a future study.
